# Stacked Guide CLI Tool

This cli tool's purpose is to offer an interactive experience to learn how the stacking workflow, well, works.

It does this with the help of [git-town](https://www.git-town.com/) and its nested feature branches support.

You can find the generated documentation in `.md` and `man pages` format in the [docs](./docs) directory.

## Requirements

For this tool to work you'll need to have `git-town` installed already. Just follow the steps in the [installation](https://www.git-town.com/install) page and then proceed with the setup.

In the setup you'll also be asked for a GitHub token so that git-town can then make Pull Requests. This step is done interactively so you can set it up when running the `setup` command.
